            answer: 'Getting an online personal loan from FundsMama is very easy. Just visit our website or download the FundsMama app, fill out an online form with a few details and submit it. Thereafter, you will get an email requesting for documents, which you can scan and submit through email. Then, we evaluate your application and then give you a call to discuss the loan structure and repayment terms. Then, if all the parameters are satisfied, we disburse the loan within 24-36 hours.'
        },
        {
            question: 'How are loan amounts decided and how do I get the maximum loan amount?',
            answer: 'We have an efficient loan underwriting system that checks various criteria for your loan worthiness, including your CIBIL score, monthly salary, existing loans, etc., while deciding your loan amount. Depending upon your salary and your credit history, you can receive up to 80% of your salary.'
        },
        {
            question: 'How and when can I repay my personal loan?',
            answer: 'We have a flexible loan repayment system where you can choose the duration of your tenure from 12-60 months. You can repay your loan in fixed equated monthly instalments (EMI), which will be auto-debited from your salary account on a fixed date every month. To activate the auto-debit facility, we will take an e-mandate from you at the time of disbursal of your loan.'
        },
        {
            question: 'What rate of interest will be charged?',
            answer: 'The rate of interest that you will be charged will depend on the type of loan that you take. For a personal loan, the rate of interest ranges between X% and Y%, while for a short-term loan, it can vary between X% and Y%. Our processes are transparent and you will get complete information on the loan structure at the time of application.'
        },
        {
            question: 'Can I prepay my existing personal loan?',
            answer: 'Yes, prepayment or foreclosure of your personal loan is possible without any charges, provided you complete the payment of the first 6 EMIs. Some charges will be applicable if you choose to foreclose your loan before 6 months from date of disbursement.'
        },
        {
            question: 'How do I know if I am eligible for a personal loan?',

                                We all need an infusion of cash from time to time to meet various needs that go above and beyond our salaries or fixed incomes. You may need money for unplanned expenses such as a medical emergency or you may be planning to buy a vehicle, renovate your house, go on a family vacation, meet wedding expenses, or purchase high-end household items or electronic gadgets.

                                Traditionally, most people faced with such situations, approach their family or friends, or even consider breaking a fixed deposit. More recently, it has become more convenient to use credit cards, which can end up being prohibitively expensive due to extremely high interest rates and additional/hidden charges. Many take personal loans from their banks, which can be a difficult, time-consuming and stressful process involving tons of paperwork, phone calls and multiple visits to your branch.
