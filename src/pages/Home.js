            "question": "Will I get a personal loan if my CIBIL score is low?",
            "answer": "Having a low CIBIL score does not automatically preclude you from getting a loan, but it will affect the amount of loan that you can avail and the loan structure that you will get. Having a good CIBIL score allows you the opportunity to get higher loan amounts with better interest rates."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is a loan top-up and how do I get one?",
            "answer": "A loan top-up is an additional loan over and above your existing loan. You can apply for a loan top-up after completing 6 successful EMI payments. To find out more about loan top-ups, call our dedicated customer care number."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do I select my loan tenure?",
            "answer": "Selecting your loan tenure is a balancing act. If you select a low tenure, your EMIs will be higher, but you will pay less interest. If you select a longer tenure, your EMIs will be lower but you will end up paying more interest. You should carefully select your tenure based on your monthly financial outflow. Talk to our experts to get a better understanding."
        },
        {
            "question": "How much time will it take to get a loan from FundsMama?",
            "answer": "FundsMama's loan disbursal process is among the fastest in the industry. From the time of application, it will take us up to 24 hours to evaluate your eligibility and approve your loan. Post approval, it will take us up to 36 hours to disburse your loan amount."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I find out my EMI without applying for a loan?",
            "answer": "You can visit our website or download our app and use our free EMI calculator, which will give you details about your EMI."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do I apply for a medical emergency loan?",
            "answer": "Applying for a medical emergency loan from FundsMama is a fast and easy process. Just visit our website or download our app and fill in the details in the online form with your name, phone number, email id, etc. as well as your salary details and expected loan amount."
        },

            "answer": "No, there are no restrictions. FundsMama's Medical Emergency Loans can be used for any medical purpose including hospitalization expenses, medicines and post-hospitalization expenses."
